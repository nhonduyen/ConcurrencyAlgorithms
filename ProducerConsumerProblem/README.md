The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science that illustrates the need for coordinating multiple threads sharing a common, finite-size buffer. 
The producer generates data and puts it into the buffer, and the consumer takes data from the buffer. 
Proper synchronization is necessary to ensure that the producer does not add data when the buffer is full and the consumer does not remove data when the buffer is empty.
